# Pika-shoot!
This game was created after two weeks of starting my Web Development bootcamp with no previous code experience. 
Please take into account that I didn't even know what an array was before creating this game.
It's only possible to play it on a computer browser, as it's not adapted to be played on mobile devices. 
---
Pikachu is going for a run by the beach and has to avoid any pokemon he might encounter.<br>
He can do it by jumping over or shooting them but... watch out! <br>
He has to first collect enough pokeballs in order to have the energy to do that!
